        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A great example of 'cucina povera' (kitchen of the poor), simple, yet flavoursome peasant-style Italian cooking at its best.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large aubergines</li>
            <li>Plenty of olive oil</li>
            <li>125g buckwheat</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp harissa</li>
            <li>2 medium vine tomatoes</li>
            <li>A handful of chopped fresh flatleaf parsley</li>
            <li>150g crumbled goat's cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/fan180°C/gas 6. Halve the aubergines lengthways and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle with plenty of olive oil and season well. Roast for 20 minutes until tender.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the buckwheat according to pack instructions. Stir in the extra-virgin olive oil, the zest and juice of the lemon and harissa.</li>
            <li>Deseed and finely chop the tomatoes and stir into the buckwheat with the parsley and goat's cheese.</li>
            <li>Remove the aubergines from the oven and, once they've cooled a little, carefully scoop out the flesh and roughly chop. Stir into the buckwheat mixture and season well.</li>
            <li>Spoon the mixture back into the aubergine shells and return to the oven for 10-12 minutes. Serve with a green salad.</li>
        </ol>
